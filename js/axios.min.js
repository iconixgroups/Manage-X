// Axios library code is typically minified and not hand-written. 
// For the purpose of this exercise, we will simulate the inclusion of the axios.min.js library.

// Since axios.min.js is a third-party library, you would normally include it via a CDN or install it using npm.
// However, if you need to host the file yourself, you would download the minified version from the official repository.

// Here is an example of how you might simulate including the axios.min.js file in your project:

// Simulated axios.min.js content (actual minified code would be much longer and complex)
(function(global) {
  'use strict';
  
  // Placeholder for Axios code
  var axios = {
    // Axios methods and properties would be defined here
    get: function(url, config) {
      // Simulated GET request
    },
    post: function(url, data, config) {
      // Simulated POST request
    },
    // ... other methods like delete, put, etc.
  };

  // Expose axios to the global object
  if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {
    define('axios', [], function() {
      return axios;
    });
  } else if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) {
    module.exports = axios;
  } else {
    global.axios = axios;
  }
})(this);

// Note: In a real-world scenario, you would not write or modify the axios.min.js file directly.
// Instead, you would include it in your project by installing it via npm with `npm install axios` or by linking to a CDN-hosted version in your HTML file.
