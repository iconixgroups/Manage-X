# Security Policy for Manage X SaaS App

## Introduction
This document outlines the security measures and practices adopted by the Manage X SaaS App to protect user data and ensure a secure environment for project and task management.

## Data Encryption
- **HTTPS**: All data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user data in transit.
- **Database Encryption**: MongoDB, our database system, employs encryption at rest to secure data stored within the database, protecting it against unauthorized access.

## Authentication Mechanisms
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: We use JWT for secure, token-based user authentication. Tokens are generated upon login and used to authenticate API requests, ensuring that user sessions are securely managed.
- **Password Security**: User passwords are hashed and salted using bcrypt, a robust hashing algorithm. This practice prevents password theft, even in the event of a data breach.

## Dependency Security
- **Vulnerability Tracking**: We actively use tools like `npm audit`, `npm audit fix`, and `Snyk` to identify, mitigate, and automatically fix vulnerabilities in our project dependencies where possible.
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are regularly updated to their latest versions to incorporate security patches and reduce the risk of vulnerabilities.
## Shadcn UI Security Considerations
- **Shadcn UI Library**: With the migration to Shadcn UI for our user interface components, it's crucial to ensure that the version used does not contain known vulnerabilities. We adhere to best practices for securely implementing UI components, including regular security audits and updates.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
We take the security of our application seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within Manage X SaaS App, please report it to us responsibly by emailing security@managex.com. We commit to promptly investigating and addressing all reported vulnerabilities to maintain the security and integrity of our application.
