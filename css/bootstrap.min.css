Since the file `css/bootstrap.min.css` is typically a pre-minified version of the Bootstrap CSS framework, it is not custom code that would be written by hand. Instead, it is obtained by downloading the minified CSS file from the official Bootstrap repository or a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

To adhere to the instructions, I will provide a placeholder comment indicating that this file should contain the minified Bootstrap CSS. In practice, you would replace this comment with the actual content of the `bootstrap.min.css` file from Bootstrap's distribution.

```css
/*!
 * Bootstrap v5.0.0 (https://getbootstrap.com/)
 * Copyright 2011-2021 The Bootstrap Authors
 * Licensed under MIT (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/LICENSE)
 * This is a placeholder for the minified Bootstrap CSS.
 * In a real-world scenario, you would replace this comment with the actual minified CSS content.
 */
``` 

Please note that the version number (v5.0.0) is used as an example and may differ from the latest version available at the time of your development. You should always use the latest version compatible with your project requirements.
